# Test Coverage
# 1. Create an alert from the create alert (basic) page using enter keys
# 2. Edit an alert
# 3. Create an alert from Resume Search page (builder)
# 4. Create an alert from the create alert page using Create Resume Alert button
# 5. Each test deactivates the alert it creates and asserts the action
# 6. Test the action toggle links for activate/deactivate
#    Adhoc selenium testing may add alerts so can't guarantee the first alert is
#    always going to be active
